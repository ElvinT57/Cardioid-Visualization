# Cardioid-Visualization

By dividing a circle n times, we can visualize the times table of those points on the circle.
Using vectors and polar coordinates, we can connect the coordinates of the factor and the 
product. For each iteration, increase the factor by 0.01. Through this, we can visualize
the heart of Mathematics.
